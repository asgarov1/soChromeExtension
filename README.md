# StackOverflow Comments ChromeExtension 

## Purpose:
To provide ready to copy/paste comments for StackOverflow. Often there are questions from newbies who donâ€™t know how to ask questions on the site, so it would be nice to have a nice expanded comment that can help them ask better questions:)

e.g. To answer an assigment/homework dump question we can use a comment like:

>Welcome to Stack Overflow! You seem to be asking for someone to write some code for you. Stack Overflow is a question and answer site, not a code-writing service. Please [see here](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) to learn how to write effective questions.

Since I am too lazy to type/look up these frequently used comments this plugin allows for a quick copy paste feature.

## To install:
 - Open Chrome
 - type `chrome://extensions/`
 - click **Developer mode** toggle.
 - press the appeared **Load unpacked** button.
 - then just select the folder of this project and that is it.
